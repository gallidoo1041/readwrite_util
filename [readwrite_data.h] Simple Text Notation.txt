Simple Text Notation format.
(The parser implementation can be found in namespace 'stn' of file 'readwrite_data.h')

Reason:
[*] Creating a quick and very simple text notation format that can easily be understood and implemented.
 
[|----|] Specification:
[*] Structure:
The format is a plain text (.txt) file in ASCII encoding, comprised of attribute-value pairs as follows:
 
---------------|BEGIN
attribute
attribute_value

attribute2
attribute_value2

attribute3
attribute_value3

attribute4
attribute_value4

...
---------------|END
 
Attribute names and values are interpreted as strings, and any delimiter or indentation in front of them are treated as part of them.
Attributes and their values are separated by 1 newline character.
If an attribute value is an empty line, it will be treated as a null value:
 
---------------|BEGIN
attribute

# The line above is an empty line, therefore the attribute value is a null value.
# (Attributes with null values like this can be used as toggled attributes: to disable such attributes, comment them out (see [*] Comments.))
---------------|END

Attributes can have duplicate names; in this case, the value of the most recent occurence of that duplicate is the value of that attribute:
 
---------------|BEGIN
attribute1
hello

attribute1
world
# 'world' is the value of the attribute 'attribute1', not 'hello'
---------------|END
 
Attribute-value pairs are separated by any number of newline characters:
 
---------------|BEGIN
attribute1
blablabla







attribute2
hehehe
---------------|END
 
Attributes with the [MULTILINE] tag at the line after their name can have attribute values spanning multiple lines.
Such attribute values end with a [END_MULTILINE] tag followed by a newline on the line next to the final line of the attribute.
If there is no [END_MULTILINE] tag, or if the last [END_MULTILINE] tag is not followed by a newline, the attribute value spans the end of the file.
 
---------------|BEGIN
attribute1
[MULTILINE]
this is
multilined
[END_MULTILINE]

---------------|END
 
[*] Comments:
The format supports single line comments, with the following condition:
Single-line comments start with a hash (#) character and are allowed before an attribute name:
 
---------------|BEGIN
# This is a comment.
attribute
attribute_value

attribute2
# This is an attribute value, not a comment.

		# This is also not a comment, but an attribute.
		# Trust me!
---------------|END

[|---|] End of Simple Text Notation specification.
